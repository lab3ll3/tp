### Editing an application: edit

- INDEX - Position of the application in the list (from list command)
- c/COMPANY - (Optional) New company name
- p/POSITION - (Optional) New position title
- d/DATE - (Optional) New submission date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- s/STATUS - (Optional) New status

Example output:

### Deleting an application: `delete`
Deletes the specified application from JobPilot.

Format: `delete INDEX`

- Deletes the application at the specified INDEX.
- The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed application list though the list command.
- The index must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, ...

Examples:
- `delete 1`
- `list` followed by `delete 2`

Example output:
```text
Deleted application:
Google | SE manager | 2025-03-10 | INTERVIEW
You have 4 application(s) left.
___________________________________________________________________
```

### Updating application status: 'status'
Updates the recruitment progress of a specific job application and allows for independent note-taking. This allows you to track interview feedback or offer details separately from the company info.

Format: status INDEX [s/STATUS] [note/NOTE]

Updates the application at the specified INDEX.

s/STATUS: The current stage (e.g., Invited, Rejected, Offer).

note/NOTE: (Optional) Additional context, comments, or interview feedback.

Flexibility: You can update both fields at once, or just one. If a field is omitted, the existing value is preserved. The order of set/ and note/ does not matter.

Examples:

status 1 s/Interview note/Scheduled for next Tuesday

status 2 s/Rejected (Previous note remains unchanged)

status 3 note/Salary negotiation in progress (Status remains unchanged)

Example Output:

Plaintext
Status updated:
Google | SE manager | 2025-03-10 | INTERVIEW (Note: Scheduled for next Tuesday) | Tags: [TECH]

### Filtering applications by status: 'filter'
Retrieves all applications that match a specific status. This is useful for focusing only on active leads.

Format: filter s/STATUS

The search is case-insensitive and supports partial matching (e.g., filter status/off will find applications with the status "OFFER").

Examples:

filter s/OFFER

filter s/pending

Example Output:

Plaintext
Found 2 application(s) with status matching 'OFFER':
1. Google | SE manager | 2025-03-10 | OFFER (Note: Salary negotiation)
2. Shopee | Backend Intern | 2025-03-15 | OFFER (Note: Pending acceptance)

### Listing
Lists all the applications

Format: `list`

Example: `list`

Example Output:
```text
Here are your applications:
1. Google | SE manager | 2025-03-10 | Pending
2. Amazon | Data Analyst | 2025-03-08 | Pending
3. Microsoft | SDE Intern | 2025-03-12 | Pending

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?

**A**: Copy the application's data file from your current computer to the same file location on the new computer. 
       Make sure the application is closed before copying the file to avoid losing any recent changes.

**Q**: What should I do if I accidentally delete an application entry?

**A**: Deleted entries cannot be restored automatically. To avoid losing important information, consider keeping a backup 
       copy of your data file before making major changes.

**Q**: Why is my command not working?

**A**: Check that your command follows the correct format as provided in the `help` command and includes all required fields.

**Q**: Where is my data stored?

**A**: Your data is stored locally on your computer in the application's data folder. This allows your saved applications 
       to remain available even after you close the app.

**Q**: Can I edit an existing application entry?

**A**: Yes. You can use the edit command to edit details without creating a new entry.

**Q**: Can I use the application on multiple computers at the same time?

**A**: You can use the application on multiple computers, but changes made on one computer will not automatically sync 
       to the other unless you manually transfer the updated data file.
