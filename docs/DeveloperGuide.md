### Edit Application Feature
The Edit feature allows users to modify existing job applications. This feature was implemented by Labelle.

**Command Format**: edit INDEX [c/COMPANY] [p/POSITION] [d/DATE] [s/STATUS]

All fields after the index are optional. Only specified fields are updated.

Example Usage:
edit 1 c/Microsoft  (Update company only)
edit 2 p/Senior Engineer d/2024-12-01  (Update position and date)
edit 3 s/Interview  (Update status only)

**Implementation Details**

The Edit application feature is implemented through a Edit class:
1.	Extract index from command
2.	Validate index (1 ≤ index ≤ list size)
3.	Retrieve target Add object
4.	Parse remaining command for c/, p/, d/, s/ prefixes
5.	For each field: call corresponding setter on target
6.	Validate date format before setting
7.	Display updated application

**Sequence Diagram** (command: edit 1 c/Google p/SWE d/2024-09-12):

| Component | Method Call | Data Flow |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| User | `edit 1 c/Google p/SWE d/2024-09-12` | → JobPilot |
| JobPilot | `editApplication(input, applications)` | → Edit |
| Edit | `parseIndex()` | index = 0 |
| Edit | `applications.get(0)` | ← target application |
| Edit | `parseFields()` | c/, p/, d/ detected |
| Edit | `setCompany("Google")` | → Add |
| Edit | `setPosition("SWE")` | → Add |
| Edit | `validateDate("2024-09-12")` | valid |
| Edit | `setDate("2024-09-12")` | → Add |
| Edit | return success | → JobPilot |
| JobPilot | display result | → User |

**Error Handling**

| Error Scenario | Condition | User Response |
|----------------|-----------|---------------|
| Missing Index | User enters `edit` without a number | "Please provide an index. Example: edit 1 c/Google" |
| Invalid Index | Index is 0, negative, or exceeds list size | "Invalid application number! You have X application(s)." |
| No Fields | User provides index but no fields to update | "No valid fields to update! Use: c/, p/, d/, s/" |
| Invalid Date Format | Date not in `YYYY-MM-DD` format | "Invalid date! Use YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2024-09-12)" |

**Design Rationale**

| Decision                             | Rationale                                                        |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Separate Edit class                  | Maintains single responsibility and easier to test independently |
| Optional fields                      | Allows partial updates                                           |
| Prefix-based parsing (`c/`, `p/`, `d/`, `s/`) | Consistent with `add` command and easier for users to remember   |
| Date validation                      | Prevents invalid data from entering the system                   |

### Delete Application Feature

#### Implementation Details

The Delete application mechanism is facilitated by the main `JobPilot` class and delegated to a dedicated `Delete` utility class. The application's core state is managed within a single `ArrayList<Add>` named `applications`, which stores all job application entities.

The operations are exposed and handled internally via the following methods:

* `JobPilot#deleteApplication(String, ArrayList<Add>)` — Acts as an intermediate router that intercepts the raw user input and delegates it to the `Delete` class.
* `Delete#deleteApplication(String, ArrayList<Add>)` — Parses the string to extract the target index, validates the bounds against the `ArrayList`, removes the `Add` object, and handles the console output.

Given below is an example usage scenario demonstrating how the Delete mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user executes `delete 2`. The `Scanner` inside the `JobPilot.main()` loop reads the raw input string.

**Step 2.** The `if-else` execution block in `JobPilot.main()` recognizes the `delete` command and routes execution to the private helper method `JobPilot#deleteApplication()`.

**Step 3.** The helper method immediately delegates the operation to the static `Delete.deleteApplication()` method. The `Delete` class splits the raw string by spaces (`input.split(" ")`) to extract the index `"2"`.

**Step 4.** `Delete.deleteApplication()` parses the extracted string into an integer and converts it to a 0-based index (`1`). It validates that the index is within the valid bounds of the `applications` list.

![Steps 1 to 4](diagrams/delete/step14.png)

**Step 5.** The target `Add` object is removed via `applications.remove(1)`. Instead of returning control to a UI component, the `Delete` class directly prints the details of the removed object and the remaining application count to `System.out`.

![Step 5](diagrams/delete/step5.png)

*Note: If the user inputs a non-numeric index (e.g., `delete abc`), a `NumberFormatException` is caught internally by the `Delete` class, which then throws a custom `JobPilotException` back up to the main loop to be displayed.*

The following sequence diagram shows the flow of deleting an application:

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Command delegation:**

* **Current Implementation:** The static `Delete` class handles both the domain logic (removing the `Add` object from the `ArrayList`) and the UI logic (printing the success message via `System.out`).
    * *Pros:* Splits the workload of `JobPilot` by extracting the specific deletion into its own class.
    * *Cons:* Increased coupling. 
* **Alternative:** Have `Delete.deleteApplication` return the deleted `Add` object.
  * *Pros:* Separates concerns, making the deletion logic purely functional, highly cohesive, and significantly easier to test.
  * *Cons:* Requires refactoring the current architecture, which is difficult due to the given time constraints.

### Search by Company Feature

#### Implementation Details

The **Search by Company** feature allows users to retrieve job applications by matching a company name using a **case-insensitive partial search**. This feature is implemented directly within the `JobPilot` class through the method:

* `JobPilot#searchByCompany(ArrayList<Add>, String)`

The application's data is stored in a central `ArrayList<Add>` named `applications`, where each `Add` object represents a job application.

The search operation works by iterating through the list and checking whether each application's company name contains the user-provided search keyword.

---

Given below is an example usage scenario demonstrating how the search mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user executes `search google`. The `Scanner` inside the `JobPilot.main()` loop reads the raw input string.

**Step 2.** The `if-else` execution block in `JobPilot.main()` recognizes the `search` command and routes execution to the `JobPilot#searchByCompany()` method.

**Step 3.** Inside `searchByCompany`, the system extracts the search keyword using:
`String searchTerm = input.substring("search ".length()).trim();`
If the search term is empty, an error message is shown. If the application list is empty, the system informs the user that there are no applications to search.

**Step 4.** The method iterates through all applications and performs a case-insensitive partial match:
```
for (Add application : applications) {
    if (application.getCompany().toLowerCase().contains(searchTerm.toLowerCase())) {
        results.add(application);
    }
}
```


**Step 5.** The results are displayed to the user. If no matches are found, the system prints a corresponding message. Otherwise, all matching applications are listed.

---

The following sequence diagram shows the flow of searching by company:

```
@startuml
actor User
participant JobPilot
participant "ArrayList<Add>" as AppList
participant Add

User -> JobPilot : input "search google"
JobPilot -> JobPilot : searchByCompany(applications, input)

JobPilot -> JobPilot : extract searchTerm

loop for each application
    JobPilot -> Add : getCompany()
    Add --> JobPilot : company name
    JobPilot -> JobPilot : compare (contains)
end

JobPilot -> User : display results
@enduml
```

**Sequence Diagram** (command: search google):

| Component | Method Call | Data Flow |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| User | `search google` | → JobPilot |
| JobPilot | `searchByCompany(applications, input)` | → JobPilot |
| JobPilot | `extract searchTerm` | searchTerm = "google" |
| JobPilot | iterate applications | → ArrayList |
| JobPilot | `getCompany()` | ← Add |
| JobPilot | `toLowerCase().contains()` | match check |
| JobPilot | add to results | → results list |
| JobPilot | return results | → JobPilot |
| JobPilot | display results | → User |

---

**Error Handling**

| Error Scenario | Condition | User Response |
|----------------|-----------|---------------|
| Empty Search Term | User enters `search` without keyword | "Please provide a company name to search. Example: search google" |
| No Applications | Application list is empty | "No applications to search!" |
| No Match Found | No company matches the keyword | "No applications found for company: [keyword]" |
| Invalid Format | Input parsing fails unexpectedly | "Invalid search format! Use: search COMPANY_NAME" |

---

**Design Rationale**

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|----------|
| Implement search in `JobPilot` | Keeps implementation simple and avoids unnecessary abstraction |
| Case-insensitive matching | Improves usability by allowing flexible input |
| Partial matching using `contains()` | Allows users to search with incomplete company names |
| Linear search on `ArrayList` | Sufficient for small datasets and easy to implement |
| Direct result printing | Simplifies control flow without introducing additional layers |

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Search logic placement**

* **Current Implementation:** The search logic is implemented directly inside the `JobPilot` class.
    * *Pros:* Simple and straightforward, easy to integrate with the main command loop.
    * *Cons:* Mixes UI logic and business logic, making the method harder to test and reuse.

---

**Aspect: Matching strategy**

* **Current Implementation:** Uses case-insensitive partial matching via `toLowerCase().contains()`.
    * *Pros:* Flexible and user-friendly, supports partial input (e.g., "goo" matches "Google").
    * *Cons:* Less efficient for large datasets and limited to simple substring matching.

* **Alternative:** Use exact matching with `equalsIgnoreCase()`.
    * *Pros:* More precise and slightly more efficient.
    * *Cons:* Too strict for user input, reduces usability.

---

#### Future Improvements

- Support multi-field search (e.g., company + position)
- Implement fuzzy search to handle typos
- Introduce indexing for faster lookup in large datasets
- Separate search logic into its own component for better modularity
