## Design

### UI Component

The API of this component is specified in `Ui.java`.

![Ui Component](diagrams/component-ui/ui-class.png)

The UI consists of a centralized `Ui` class that serves as the boundary between the user and the system. Since it is a CLI application, it relies on standard input and output.

The `UI` component uses the standard Java `Scanner` to capture user input. The formatting for UI outputs (e.g., the welcome logo, help menus, and application lists) is defined directly within the `Ui` class using text blocks and formatted strings.

The `UI` component,

* reads raw user commands from the console.
* displays formatted messages, search results, and errors to the user based on command execution.
* operates passively; it relies on the `JobPilot` main loop and `CommandRunner` to invoke its specific display methods (e.g., `showApplicationAdded`, `showSearchResults`).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Application` and `IndustryTag` objects.


### Storage Component

The **API** of this component is specified in `Storage.java`.

![Ui Component](diagrams/component-ui/ui-class.png)

The `Storage` component,

* can save job application data in a text format (`.txt`), separated by '|', and read them back into corresponding `Application` objects.
* handles missing directories or files automatically by creating the necessary `data/JobPilotData.txt` file upon initialization if it does not exist.
* parses the text file, actively invalidating corrupted or invalid lines during the loading process to ensure the application does not crash upon startup.
* depends on some classes in the `task` component, because the `Storage` component's primary job is to serialize and deserialize `Application` and `IndustryTag` objects.

## Implementation

### Edit Application Feature
The Edit feature allows users to modify existing job applications. This feature was implemented by Labelle.

**Command Format**: edit INDEX [c/COMPANY] [p/POSITION] [d/DATE] [s/STATUS]

All fields after the index are optional. Only specified fields are updated.

Example Usage:
edit 1 c/Microsoft  (Update company only)
edit 2 p/Senior Engineer d/2024-12-01  (Update position and date)
edit 3 s/Interview  (Update status only)

**Implementation Details**

The Edit application feature is implemented through a Edit class:
1.  Extract index from command
2.  Validate index (1 ≤ index ≤ list size)
3.  Retrieve target Add object
4.  Parse remaining command for c/, p/, d/, s/ prefixes
5.  For each field: call corresponding setter on target
6.  Validate date format before setting
7.  Display updated application

**Error Handling**

| Error Scenario | Condition | User Response |
|----------------|-----------|---------------|
| Missing Index | User enters `edit` without a number | "Please provide an index. Example: edit 1 c/Google" |
| Invalid Index | Index is 0, negative, or exceeds list size | "Invalid application number! You have X application(s)." |
| No Fields | User provides index but no fields to update | "No valid fields to update! Use: c/, p/, d/, s/" |
| Invalid Date Format | Date not in `YYYY-MM-DD` format | "Invalid date! Use YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2024-09-12)" |

**Sequence Diagram** ![Sequence](diagrams/edit/sequence.png)

**Design Rationale**

| Decision                             | Rationale                                                        |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Separate Edit class                  | Maintains single responsibility and easier to test independently |
| Optional fields                      | Allows partial updates                                           |
| Prefix-based parsing (`c/`, `p/`, `d/`, `s/`) | Consistent with `add` command and easier for users to remember   |
| Date validation                      | Prevents invalid data from entering the system                   |

### Delete Application Feature

#### Implementation Details

The Delete application mechanism is facilitated by the `CommandRunner` component, which manages the application's core state through an `ArrayList<Application>` named `applications`.

The operations are exposed and handled internally via the following flow:

* `DeleterParser#parse(String)` — Parses the raw user input to extract the target index, converting it to a 0-based index and returning a structured `ParsedCommand` object.
* `CommandRunner#run(ParsedCommand)` — Acts as the central router, matching the `DELETE` command type and coordinating between the logic and UI components.
* `Deleter#deleteApplication(ArrayList<Application>, int)` — Validates the array bounds, removes the target `Application` object from the memory list, and returns the removed object.
* `Ui#showApplicationDeleted(Application, int)` — Handles the console output to inform the user of the successful deletion.

Given below is an example usage scenario demonstrating how the Delete mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user executes `delete 2`. The `Ui.readCommand()` method captures the raw input string.

**Step 2.** The input is passed to `Parser.parse()`, which identifies the `delete` keyword and delegates to `DeleterParser.parse()`.

**Step 3.** `DeleterParser` splits the string, extracts the index `"2"`, converts it to a 0-based integer (`1`), and packages it into a `ParsedCommand(type=DELETE, index=1)` object.

**Step 4.** The `CommandRunner#run()` method receives the `ParsedCommand`. The `switch` statement recognizes the `DELETE` type and invokes `Deleter.deleteApplication(applications, cmd.index)`.

![Steps 1 to 4](diagrams/delete/step14.png)

**Step 5.** `Deleter` validates that index `1` is within the valid bounds of the `applications` list. It removes the target `Application` object via `applications.remove(1)` and returns the deleted object back to the `CommandRunner`.

![Step 5](diagrams/delete/step5.png)

**Step 6.** `CommandRunner` receives the deleted `Application` and passes it to `Ui.showApplicationDeleted(removed, applications.size())`, which safely prints the confirmation message to the console.

*Note: If the user inputs a non-numeric index (e.g., `delete abc`), a `NumberFormatException` is caught internally by the `DeleterParser`, which then throws a custom `JobPilotException`. This exception is caught in `Parser`, returning an `ERROR` type `ParsedCommand` that the `Ui` displays.*

The following sequence diagram shows the flow of deleting an application:

![Sequence](diagrams/delete/sequence.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Command delegation and Separation of Concerns:**

* **Current Implementation:** The `Deleter` class is strictly responsible for domain logic (removing the `Application` object from the `ArrayList`) and returns the deleted object back to the caller. It does not contain any `System.out.println` statements.
  * *Pros:* High cohesion and loose coupling. By returning the object rather than printing directly, the deletion logic becomes purely functional. This makes `Deleter` extremely easy to unit test and ensures that formatting changes only need to be made in the `Ui` class.
  * *Cons:* Requires a slightly longer call chain (Parser -> Runner -> Deleter -> Ui) compared to a monolithic approach.
* **Alternative:** Have `Deleter.deleteApplication` handle the `ArrayList` removal and print the success message directly to the console.
  * *Pros:* Less boilerplate code and fewer method hand-offs in the `CommandRunner`.
  * *Cons:* Violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by mixing domain logic with presentation logic, making automated testing difficult and UI migrations (e.g., moving to a GUI) nearly impossible.

### Search by Company Feature

#### Implementation Details

The **Search by Company** feature allows users to retrieve job applications by matching a company name using a **case-insensitive partial search**. This feature is implemented directly within the `JobPilot` class through the method:

* `JobPilot#searchByCompany(ArrayList<Add>, String)`

The application's data is stored in a central `ArrayList<Add>` named `applications`, where each `Add` object represents a job application.

The search operation works by iterating through the list and checking whether each application's company name contains the user-provided search keyword.

---

Given below is an example usage scenario demonstrating how the search mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user executes `search google`. The `Scanner` inside the `JobPilot.main()` loop reads the raw input string.

**Step 2.** The `if-else` execution block in `JobPilot.main()` recognizes the `search` command and routes execution to the `JobPilot#searchByCompany()` method.

**Step 3.** Inside `searchByCompany`, the system extracts the search keyword using:
`String searchTerm = input.substring("search ".length()).trim();`
If the search term is empty, an error message is shown. If the application list is empty, the system informs the user that there are no applications to search.

**Step 4.** The method iterates through all applications and performs a case-insensitive partial match:
for (Add application : applications) {
if (application.getCompany().toLowerCase().contains(searchTerm.toLowerCase())) {
results.add(application);
}
}



**Step 5.** The results are displayed to the user. If no matches are found, the system prints a corresponding message. Otherwise, all matching applications are listed.

---

#### Sequence Diagrams
##### Main Success Flow
The following diagram illustrates the normal execution flow when a user performs a valid search:
![search_main.png](diagrams/search/search_main.png)
##### Empty Search Term
The following diagram shows the system behavior when the user provides an empty search keyword:
![search_empty.png](diagrams/search/search_empty.png)
##### No Match Found
The following diagram illustrates the case where no applications match the search keyword:
![search_nomatch.png](diagrams/search/search_nomatch.png)

---

**Error Handling**

| Error Scenario | Condition | User Response |
|----------------|-----------|---------------|
| Empty Search Term | User enters `search` without keyword | "Please provide a company name to search. Example: search google" |
| No Applications | Application list is empty | "No applications to search!" |
| No Match Found | No company matches the keyword | "No applications found for company: [keyword]" |
| Invalid Format | Input parsing fails unexpectedly | "Invalid search format! Use: search COMPANY_NAME" |

---

**Design Rationale**

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|----------|
| Implement search in `JobPilot` | Keeps implementation simple and avoids unnecessary abstraction |
| Case-insensitive matching | Improves usability by allowing flexible input |
| Partial matching using `contains()` | Allows users to search with incomplete company names |
| Linear search on `ArrayList` | Sufficient for small datasets and easy to implement |
| Direct result printing | Simplifies control flow without introducing additional layers |

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Search logic placement**

* **Current Implementation:** The search logic is implemented directly inside the `JobPilot` class.
  * *Pros:* Simple and straightforward, easy to integrate with the main command loop.
  * *Cons:* Mixes UI logic and business logic, making the method harder to test and reuse.

---

**Aspect: Matching strategy**

* **Current Implementation:** Uses case-insensitive partial matching via `toLowerCase().contains()`.
  * *Pros:* Flexible and user-friendly, supports partial input (e.g., "goo" matches "Google").
  * *Cons:* Less efficient for large datasets and limited to simple substring matching.

* **Alternative:** Use exact matching with `equalsIgnoreCase()`.
  * *Pros:* More precise and slightly more efficient.
  * *Cons:* Too strict for user input, reduces usability.

---

#### Future Improvements

- Support multi-field search (e.g., company + position)
- Implement fuzzy search to handle typos
- Introduce indexing for faster lookup in large datasets
- Separate search logic into its own component for better modularity

---

### Sort Application Feature

#### Implementation Details

The Sort feature allows users to sort all job applications by date in ascending chronological order. This feature is implemented directly within the `JobPilot` class.

**Command Format**: `sort`

The command does not require any parameters. When executed, all applications are sorted by date automatically.

Example Usage:
- `sort` (Sort all applications by date)

The sorting logic is implemented in the method:

- `JobPilot#sortApplications(ArrayList<Add>)`

Applications are stored in a central `ArrayList<Add>`. The list is sorted using a date comparator: Collections.sort(applications, Comparator.comparing(Add::getDate));


Given below is an example usage scenario:

**Step 1.** The user executes `sort`. Input is read in `JobPilot.main()`.

**Step 2.** The system detects the `sort` command and calls `sortApplications`.

**Step 3.** The method checks if the application list is empty.

**Step 4.** If not empty, the list is sorted in ascending order by date.

**Step 5.** The sorted list is displayed to the user.

---

#### Error Handling

| Error Scenario | Condition | User Response |
|----------------|----------|---------------|
| No Applications | Application list is empty | "No applications to sort!" |

---

#### Design Rationale

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|----------|
| Sort by date automatically | Most logical for job tracking |
| Ascending order | Ensures earliest applications appear first |
| No command parameters | Keeps command simple and intuitive |
| Use `Collections.sort` | Reliable and easy to maintain |

---

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Sorting logic placement**

* **Current Implementation:** Sorting handled in `JobPilot`
  * *Pros:* Simple and direct integration
  * *Cons:* Slight coupling with main class

---

### Tag Industry to Job Application Feature

#### Implementation Details

The Tag feature allows users to add or remove industry tags for job applications. Tags are automatically converted to uppercase and duplicates are prevented. This feature is implemented using a dedicated `IndustryTag` class.

**Command Format**: `tag INDEX add/TAG` or `tag INDEX remove/TAG`

Example Usage:
- `tag 1 add/TECH`
- `tag 2 remove/FINANCE`

The feature is implemented using the following methods:

- `JobPilot#tagApplication(String, ArrayList<Add>)`
- `IndustryTag#executeTagCommand(ArrayList<Add>, String)`

Given below is an example usage scenario:

**Step 1.** The user executes a tag command.

**Step 2.** `JobPilot` routes the command to `IndustryTag`.

**Step 3.** The index, action, and tag content are parsed.

**Step 4.** The target application is retrieved.

**Step 5.** The tag is added or removed:
- Converted to uppercase
- Duplicate tags prevented

**Step 6.** The updated application is displayed.

---

#### Error Handling

| Error Scenario | Condition | User Response |
|----------------|----------|---------------|
| Missing index | No index provided | "Please provide an index. Example: tag 1 add/TECH" |
| Invalid index | Out of bounds | "Invalid application number!" |
| Empty tag | No tag content | "Tag cannot be empty!" |
| Remove non-existent tag | Tag not found | "Tag not found on this application!" |

---

#### Design Rationale

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|----------|
| Separate `IndustryTag` class | Improves modularity and separation of concerns |
| Uppercase tags | Ensures consistency |
| Deduplication | Prevents redundant data |
| `add/` and `remove/` syntax | Matches existing command patterns |

### Filter by Status Feature

#### Implementation Details
The **Filter by Status** mechanism allows users to retrieve a subset of applications matching a specific status (e.g., "OFFER"). This is implemented via a dedicated `Filterer` utility class and a `FilterParser` sub-parser, following the **Separation of Concerns** principle used in the `Delete` and `Edit` features.

The operations are handled via the following methods:
* `FilterParser#parse(String)` — Extracts the status query from the raw input (e.g., extracts "OFFER" from `filter status/OFFER`).
* `Filterer#filterByStatus(ArrayList<Application>, String, Ui)` — Iterates through the list, performs the logical match, and delegates the display to the `Ui` class.

**Execution Scenario**

**Step 1.** The user executes `filter status/OFFER`. The `Scanner` in `JobPilot.main()` reads the input string.

**Step 2.** The `Parser` identifies the `filter` keyword and routes execution to `FilterParser.parse("filter status/OFFER")`.

**Step 3.** `FilterParser` validates the `status/` prefix, extracts the string `"OFFER"`, and returns a `ParsedCommand` object with `type = FILTER` and `searchTerm = "OFFER"`.

**Step 4.** The `switch` block in `JobPilot.main()` catches the `FILTER` case and calls `Filterer.filterByStatus(applications, cmd.searchTerm, ui)`.

**Step 5.** The `Filterer` iterates through the `ArrayList<Application>`. For each application, it performs a case-insensitive check:
`app.getStatus().toUpperCase().contains(query.toUpperCase())`.

**Step 6.** Matching applications are added to a temporary results list, which is then passed to `ui.showApplicationList(results)` for final display.

![Filter Sequence Diagram](diagrams/filter/sequence_diagram.png)

#### Design Rationale

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Separate `Filterer` Class** | Maintains the Single Responsibility Principle and simplifies unit testing. |
| **Case-Insensitive `contains()`** | Provides a "search-like" experience, allowing partial matches (e.g., "OFF" matches "OFFER"). |
| **Logging (v2.0 requirement)** | Uses `java.util.logging` to track filter queries for developer diagnostics. |

#### Error Handling

| Error Scenario | Condition | User Response |
|----------------|-----------|---------------|
| Missing Arguments | User enters `filter` alone | "Filter command is missing arguments! Use: filter status/STATUS" |
| Missing Prefix | User enters `filter PENDING` | "Invalid filter format! Expected: filter status/STATUS" |
| Empty Value | User enters `filter status/` | "Status value cannot be empty!" |

### Separate Notes from Status Feature

#### Implementation Details

This feature separates the original `status` field into `status` and `notes`, allowing independent updates.

**Command Format**: `status INDEX set/STATUS note/NOTES`

Example Usage:
- `status 1 set/OFFER note/Negotiate salary`
- `status 2 set/INTERVIEW note/Prepare portfolio`

The feature is implemented in:

- `JobPilot#updateStatus(String, ArrayList<Add>)`

Given below is an example usage scenario:

**Step 1.** The user executes a status command.

**Step 2.** Input is parsed to extract index, status, and notes.

**Step 3.** The target application is retrieved.

**Step 4.** `setStatus()` and `setNotes()` are called.

**Step 5.** The updated application is displayed.

---

#### Error Handling

| Error Scenario | Condition | User Response |
|----------------|----------|---------------|
| Missing index | No index provided | "Please provide an index." |
| Invalid index | Out of range | "Invalid application number!" |
| Invalid format | Incorrect syntax | "Invalid status format!" |
| Empty status | No status given | "Status cannot be empty!" |

---

#### Design Rationale

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|----------|
| Separate status and notes | Improves clarity of data |
| Dedicated command | Keeps logic focused |
| `note/` prefix | Supports multi-word notes |
| Backward compatibility | Existing data remains valid |
