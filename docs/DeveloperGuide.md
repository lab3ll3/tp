# Developer Guide

## Acknowledgements

This project was guided by the [SE-EDU initiative's](https://se-education.org) AddressBook-Level3 (AB3). We took guidance from its core architecture., parser design, 
and command execution flow to better suit JobPilot.

## Design

### UI Component

The API of this component is specified in `Ui.java`.

![Ui Component](diagrams/component-ui/ui-class.png)

The UI consists of a centralized `Ui` class that serves as the boundary between the user and the system. Since it is a CLI application, it relies on standard input and output.

The `UI` component uses the standard Java `Scanner` to capture user input. The formatting for UI outputs (e.g., the welcome logo, help menus, and application lists) is defined directly within the `Ui` class using text blocks and formatted strings.

The `UI` component,

* reads raw user commands from the console.
* displays formatted messages, search results, and errors to the user based on command execution.
* operates passively; it relies on the `JobPilot` main loop and `CommandRunner` to invoke its specific display methods (e.g., `showApplicationAdded`, `showSearchResults`).
* depends on some classes in the `task` component, as it displays `Application` and `IndustryTag` objects.

### Parser Component

The **Parser** component is responsible for interpreting raw user input and converting it into structured `ParsedCommand` objects.

![Parser Architecture](diagrams/component-parser/parser-architecture.png)
*Figure 1: Parser Component Architecture*

The following diagram illustrates how the parser processes a typical `edit` command:

![Parser Flow](diagrams/component-parser/parser-flow.png)
*Figure 2: Parser Flow for Edit Command*

### Storage Component

The **API** of this component is specified in `Storage.java`.

![Ui Component](diagrams/component-storage/storage-class.png)

The `Storage` component,

* can save job application data in a text format (`.txt`), separated by '\|', and read them back into corresponding `Application` objects.
* handles missing directories or files automatically by creating the necessary `data/JobPilotData.txt` file upon initialization if it does not exist.
* parses the text file, actively invalidating corrupted or invalid lines during the loading process to ensure the application does not crash upon startup.
* depends on some classes in the `task` component, because the `Storage` component's primary job is to serialize and deserialize `Application` and `IndustryTag` objects.

### CommandRunner Component

The **CommandRunner** component serves as the central router for all user commands. It receives a `ParsedCommand` object from the `Parser` and delegates execution to the appropriate handler.

![CommandRunner Class Diagram](diagrams/component-commandrunner/commandrunner-class.png)

The `CommandRunner` component,

* receives a `ParsedCommand` containing command type and relevant parameters (index, search term, status, notes, tag, etc.).
* maintains the central `ArrayList<Application>` that holds all job applications.
* validates command parameters (e.g., index bounds) before delegating to specialized handlers.
* coordinates between the `Ui` and domain logic classes (`Deleter`, `Editor`, `Filterer`, etc.).
* returns a boolean flag to indicate whether the application should continue running.

The following diagram illustrates how the `CommandRunner` processes different command types:

![CommandRunner Flow](diagrams/component-commandrunner/commandrunner-flow.png)

**Key Responsibilities:**

| Responsibility | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Command Routing** | Uses a switch statement to route `ParsedCommand` to the appropriate handler based on `CommandType` |
| **Index Validation** | Validates that indexes are within bounds before passing to handlers |
| **State Management** | Maintains the single source of truth for the application list |
| **Error Handling** | Catches exceptions and delegates error display to `Ui` |

**Command Types Handled:**

| Command Type | Handler | Description |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| `ADD` | `Application` constructor | Creates new application and adds to list |
| `DELETE` | `Deleter` | Removes application from list |
| `EDIT` | `Editor` | Updates fields of existing application |
| `LIST` | `Ui.showApplicationList()` | Displays all applications |
| `SORT` | `Collections.sort()` | Sorts applications by date |
| `SEARCH` | `JobPilot.searchByCompany()` | Filters applications by company name |
| `FILTER` | `Filterer` | Filters applications by status |
| `STATUS` | `Application.setStatus()` / `setNotes()` | Updates status and/or notes |
| `TAG` | `Application.addIndustryTag()` / `removeIndustryTag()` | Adds or removes industry tags |
| `HELP` | `Ui.showHelp()` | Displays available commands |
| `BYE` | None | Exits the application |

**Design Rationale:**

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Centralized command routing | All commands flow through a single component, making the execution flow easy to trace |
| Validation before delegation | Ensures invalid commands never reach domain logic, improving robustness |
| Return boolean flag | Simple mechanism to control main loop continuation without exceptions |
| Switch statement over mapping | Simple, readable, and sufficient for the number of command types |

## Implementation

### Edit Application Feature

#### Sequence Diagram

![Edit Sequence](diagrams/editor/sequence.png)
*Figure 3: Edit Feature Sequence Diagram*

**Error Handling**

| Error Scenario | Condition | User Response |
|----------------|-----------|---------------|
| Missing Index | User enters `edit` without a number | "Please provide an index. Example: edit 1 c/Google" |
| Invalid Index | Index is 0, negative, or exceeds list size | "Invalid application number! You have X application(s)." |
| No Fields | User provides index but no fields to update | "No valid fields to update! Use: c/, p/, d/, s/" |
| Invalid Date Format | Date not in `YYYY-MM-DD` format | "Invalid date! Use YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2024-09-12)" |

### Delete Application Feature

#### Implementation Details

The Delete application mechanism is facilitated by the `CommandRunner` component, which manages the application's core state through an `ArrayList<Application>` named `applications`.

The operations are exposed and handled internally via the following flow:

* `DeleterParser#parse(String)` — Parses the raw user input to extract the target index, converting it to a 0-based index and returning a structured `ParsedCommand` object.
* `CommandRunner#run(ParsedCommand)` — Acts as the central router, matching the `DELETE` command type and coordinating between the logic and UI components.
* `Deleter#deleteApplication(ArrayList<Application>, int)` — Validates the array bounds, removes the target `Application` object from the memory list, and returns the removed object.
* `Ui#showApplicationDeleted(Application, int)` — Handles the console output to inform the user of the successful deletion.

Given below is an example usage scenario demonstrating how the Delete mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user executes `delete 2`. The `Ui.readCommand()` method captures the raw input string.

**Step 2.** The input is passed to `Parser.parse()`, which identifies the `delete` keyword and delegates to `DeleterParser.parse()`.

**Step 3.** `DeleterParser` splits the string, extracts the index `"2"`, converts it to a 0-based integer (`1`), and packages it into a `ParsedCommand(type=DELETE, index=1)` object.

**Step 4.** The `CommandRunner#run()` method receives the `ParsedCommand`. The `switch` statement recognizes the `DELETE` type and invokes `Deleter.deleteApplication(applications, cmd.index)`.

![Steps 1 to 4](diagrams/delete/step14.png)

**Step 5.** `Deleter` validates that index `1` is within the valid bounds of the `applications` list. It removes the target `Application` object via `applications.remove(1)` and returns the deleted object back to the `CommandRunner`.

![Step 5](diagrams/delete/step5.png)

**Step 6.** `CommandRunner` receives the deleted `Application` and passes it to `Ui.showApplicationDeleted(removed, applications.size())`, which safely prints the confirmation message to the console.

*Note: If the user inputs a non-numeric index (e.g., `delete abc`), a `NumberFormatException` is caught internally by the `DeleterParser`, which then throws a custom `JobPilotException`. This exception is caught in `Parser`, returning an `ERROR` type `ParsedCommand` that the `Ui` displays.*

The following sequence diagram shows the flow of deleting an application:

![Sequence](diagrams/delete/sequence.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Command delegation and Separation of Concerns:**

* **Current Implementation:** The `Deleter` class is strictly responsible for domain logic (removing the `Application` object from the `ArrayList`) and returns the deleted object back to the caller. It does not contain any `System.out.println` statements.
  * *Pros:* High cohesion and loose coupling. By returning the object rather than printing directly, the deletion logic becomes purely functional. This makes `Deleter` extremely easy to unit test and ensures that formatting changes only need to be made in the `Ui` class.
  * *Cons:* Requires a slightly longer call chain (Parser -> Runner -> Deleter -> Ui) compared to a monolithic approach.
* **Alternative:** Have `Deleter.deleteApplication` handle the `ArrayList` removal and print the success message directly to the console.
  * *Pros:* Less boilerplate code and fewer method hand-offs in the `CommandRunner`.
  * *Cons:* Violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by mixing domain logic with presentation logic, making automated testing difficult and UI migrations (e.g., moving to a GUI) nearly impossible.

### Multi-Type Search Feature

#### Implementation Details

The **Multi-Type Search** feature allows users to retrieve job applications by matching **company name, position, or status** using a **case-insensitive partial search**. This feature is implemented directly within the `JobPilot` class through the method:

* `JobPilot#search(ArrayList<Application>, String type, String query)`

The application's data is stored in a central `ArrayList<Application>` named `applications`, where each `Application` object represents a job application.

The search operation works by iterating through the list and checking whether each application's relevant field contains the user-provided search keyword:

* Type `"c"` → company name
* Type `"p"` → position
* Type `"s"` → status

---

Given below is an example usage scenario demonstrating how the search mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user executes one of the following commands:

```text
search c/google
search p/software engineer
search s/interviewed
```

The Scanner inside the JobPilot.main() loop reads the raw input string.

**Step 2.** The if-else execution block in JobPilot.main() recognizes the search command and routes execution to the JobPilot#search() method.

**Step 3.** Inside search, the system extracts the search type and keyword:
```text
String type = input.substring("search ".length(), input.indexOf("/")).trim();
String query = input.substring(input.indexOf("/") + 1).trim();
```
If the search type or query is empty, an error message is shown. If the application list is empty, the system informs the user that there are no applications to search.

**Step 4.** The method iterates through all applications and performs a case-insensitive partial match:
```text
for (Application application : applications) {
    if (matches(application, type, query.toLowerCase())) {
        results.add(application);
    }
}
```
`matches()` checks the corresponding field:
- `"c"` → `application.getCompany().toLowerCase().contains(query)`
- `"p"`→ `application.getPosition().toLowerCase().contains(query)`
- `s` → `application.getStatus().toLowerCase().contains(query)`

**Step 5.** The results are displayed to the user. If no matches are found, the system prints a corresponding message. Otherwise, all matching applications are listed.

|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Empty Search Term     | User enters `search c/`, `p/`, or `s/` without keyword | "Search value cannot be empty!"                              |
| No Applications       | Application list is empty                     | "No applications to search!"                                 |

**Design Rationale**

| Decision                            | Rationale                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Implement search in `JobPilot`      | Keeps implementation simple and avoids unnecessary abstraction           |
| Support multiple search types       | Improves usability by allowing field-specific searches                  |
| Case-insensitive matching           | Flexible input, user-friendly                                           |

| Direct result printing               | Simplifies control flow without extra layers                             |

---

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Search logic placement**

* **Current Implementation:** The search logic is implemented directly inside the `JobPilot` class.
    * *Pros:* Simple and straightforward, easy to integrate with the main command loop.
    * *Cons:* Mixes UI and business logic, harder to test in isolation.

---

**Aspect: Matching strategy**

* **Current Implementation:** Case-insensitive partial matching via `toLowerCase().contains()`.
    * *Pros:* Flexible, supports partial input (e.g., "goo" matches "Google").
    * *Cons:* Less efficient for large datasets, limited to substring matching.

* **Alternative:** Exact match using `equalsIgnoreCase()`.
    * *Pros:* More precise, slightly more efficient.
    * *Cons:* Too strict, reduces usability.

---

#### Future Improvements

- Support multi-field search (e.g., `search c/google p/developer`)
- Implement fuzzy search for typo tolerance
- Introduce indexing for faster lookups in large datasets
- Extract search logic into a separate class for better modularity

### Sort Application Feature

#### Implementation Details

The Sort feature allows users to sort all job applications by date in ascending chronological order. This feature is implemented directly within the `JobPilot` class.

**Command Format**: `sort`

The command does not require any parameters. When executed, all applications are sorted by date automatically.

Example Usage:
- `sort` (Sort all applications by date)

The sorting logic is implemented in the method:

- `JobPilot#sortApplications(ArrayList<Application>)`

Applications are stored in a central `ArrayList<Application>`. The list is sorted using a date comparator: Collections.sort(applications, Comparator.comparing(Application::getDate));


Given below is an example usage scenario:

**Step 1.** The user executes `sort`. Input is read in `JobPilot.main()`.

**Step 2.** The system detects the `sort` command and calls `sortApplications`.

**Step 3.** The method checks if the application list is empty.

**Step 4.** If not empty, the list is sorted in ascending order by date.

**Step 5.** The sorted list is displayed to the user.

---

#### Error Handling

| Error Scenario | Condition | User Response |
|----------------|----------|---------------|
| No Applications | Application list is empty | "No applications to sort!" |

---

#### Design Rationale

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|----------|
| Sort by date automatically | Most logical for job tracking |
| Ascending order | Ensures earliest applications appear first |
| No command parameters | Keeps command simple and intuitive |
| Use `Collections.sort` | Reliable and easy to maintain |

---

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Sorting logic placement**

* **Current Implementation:** Sorting handled in `JobPilot`
  * *Pros:* Simple and direct integration
  * *Cons:* Slight coupling with main class

---

### Tag Industry to Job Application Feature

#### Implementation Details

The Tag feature allows users to add or remove industry tags for job applications. Tags are automatically normalized to uppercase, trimmed of whitespace, and duplicates are automatically prevented. This feature is implemented using a dedicated `IndustryTag` class and integrated with the `Application` model.

**Command Format**:
- `tag INDEX add/TAG` — Add a tag to an application
- `tag INDEX remove/TAG` — Remove a tag from an application

**Example Usage**:
- `tag 1 add/TECH` — Adds tag "TECH" to application at index 1
- `tag 2 remove/FINANCE` — Removes tag "FINANCE" from application at index 2

The feature is implemented using the following components:
- `IndustryTag` — Immutable value object representing a normalized tag
- `Application` — Stores a `Set<IndustryTag>` and provides `addIndustryTag()` and `removeIndustryTag()` methods
- `CommandRunner` — Routes the command to the appropriate handler
- `TagParser` — Parses the raw input to extract index, action, and tag content

Given below is an example usage scenario demonstrating how the Tag mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user executes `tag 1 add/TECH`. The command is read by `Ui` and passed to `Parser`.

**Step 2.** `Parser` identifies the `tag` keyword and delegates to `TagParser.parse()`.

**Step 3.** `TagParser` extracts the index `1`, action `add`, and tag content `TECH`. It returns a `ParsedCommand` object with type `TAG`, index, action, and tag.

**Step 4.** `CommandRunner` receives the `ParsedCommand` and validates the index is within bounds.

**Step 5.** `CommandRunner` calls `Application.addIndustryTag(new IndustryTag("TECH"))` on the target application.

**Step 6.** The `IndustryTag` constructor normalizes the tag (trim → uppercase), and the tag is added to the `Set<IndustryTag>` (duplicates automatically ignored).

**Step 7.** `Ui.showTagAdded()` displays the updated application with its tags.

#### Sequence Diagram

The following sequence diagram illustrates the flow of adding a tag to an application:

![Tag Sequence Diagram](diagrams/tag/sequence.png)

#### Error Handling

| Error Scenario | Condition | User Response |
|----------------|-----------|---------------|
| Missing index | User enters `tag add/TECH` without index | "Please provide an index. Example: tag 1 add/TECH" |
| Invalid index | Index is 0, negative, or exceeds list size | "Invalid application number! You have X application(s)." |
| Invalid format | Missing `add/` or `remove/` prefix | "Invalid tag format! Use: tag INDEX add/TAG or tag INDEX remove/TAG" |
| Empty tag | User enters `tag 1 add/` | "Tag cannot be empty!" |
| Remove non-existent tag | Tag not found on application | "Tag not found on this application!" |

#### Design Rationale

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|----------|
| Dedicated `IndustryTag` class | Encapsulates tag normalization logic (uppercase, trim) and ensures immutability |
| Use `Set<IndustryTag>` | Automatically prevents duplicate tags |
| Tag normalization (uppercase) | Ensures consistency and prevents case-sensitive duplicates |
| `add/` and `remove/` syntax | Matches existing command patterns (`set/`, `note/`) |
| Separate `TagParser` | Maintains separation of concerns and simplifies unit testing |

### Filter by Status Feature

#### Implementation Details

The **Filter by Status** mechanism allows users to retrieve a subset of applications matching a specific status (e.g., "OFFER"). This is implemented via a dedicated `Filterer` utility class and a `FilterParser` sub-parser, following the **Separation of Concerns** principle used in the `Delete` and `Edit` features.

The operations are handled via the following methods:
* `FilterParser#parse(String)` — Extracts the status query from the raw input (e.g., extracts "OFFER" from `filter s/OFFER`).
* `Filterer#filterByStatus(ArrayList<Application>, String, Ui)` — Iterates through the list, performs the logical match, and delegates the display to the `Ui` class.

**Execution Scenario**

**Step 1.** The user executes `filter s/OFFER`. The `Scanner` in `JobPilot.main()` reads the input string.

**Step 2.** The `Parser` identifies the `filter` keyword and routes execution to `FilterParser.parse("filter s/OFFER")`.

**Step 3.** `FilterParser` validates the `s/` prefix, extracts the string `"OFFER"`, and returns a `ParsedCommand` object with `type = FILTER` and `searchTerm = "OFFER"`.

**Step 4.** The `switch` block in `JobPilot.main()` catches the `FILTER` case and calls `Filterer.filterByStatus(applications, cmd.searchTerm, ui)`.

**Step 5.** The `Filterer` iterates through the `ArrayList<Application>`. For each application, it performs a case-insensitive check:
`app.getStatus().toUpperCase().contains(query.toUpperCase())`.

**Step 6.** Matching applications are added to a temporary results list, which is then passed to `ui.showApplicationList(results)` for final display.

#### Sequence Diagram

The following sequence diagram illustrates the flow of filtering applications by status:

![Filter Sequence Diagram](diagrams/filter/sequence.png)


#### Design Rationale

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Separate `Filterer` Class** | Maintains the Single Responsibility Principle and simplifies unit testing. |
| **Case-Insensitive `contains()`** | Provides a "search-like" experience, allowing partial matches (e.g., "OFF" matches "OFFER"). |


#### Error Handling

| Error Scenario | Condition | User Response |
|----------------|-----------|---------------|
| Missing Arguments | User enters `filter` alone | "Filter command is missing arguments! Use: filter status/STATUS" |
| Missing Prefix | User enters `filter PENDING` | "Invalid filter format! Expected: filter status/STATUS" |
| Empty Value | User enters `filter s/` | "Status value cannot be empty!" |

### Separate Notes from Status Feature

#### Implementation Details

This feature separates the original `status` field into two independent fields: `status` (application progress) and `notes` (user comments). This allows users to update status and notes independently without overwriting the other.

**Command Format**: `status INDEX s/STATUS note/NOTES`

**Example Usage**:
- `status 1 s/OFFER note/Negotiate salary` — Update both status and notes
- `status 2 s/INTERVIEW` — Update status only (notes unchanged)
- `status 3 note/Follow up next week` — Update notes only (status unchanged)

The feature is implemented using the following components:
- `Application` — Stores `status` and `notes` as separate fields with getter/setter methods
- `StatusParser` — Parses the raw input to extract index, status value, and notes
- `CommandRunner` — Routes the command and updates the target application

Given below is an example usage scenario demonstrating how the Status mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user executes `status 1 s/OFFER note/Negotiate salary`. The command is read by `Ui` and passed to `Parser`.

**Step 2.** `Parser` identifies the `status` keyword and delegates to `StatusParser.parse()`.

**Step 3.** `StatusParser` extracts the index `1`, status value `OFFER` (after `s/`), and notes `Negotiate salary` (after `note/`). It returns a `ParsedCommand` object with type `STATUS`, index, status, and notes.

**Step 4.** `CommandRunner` validates the index is within bounds and retrieves the target `Application`.

**Step 5.** `CommandRunner` calls `app.setStatus(status)` if status is provided, and `app.setNotes(notes)` if notes are provided.

**Step 6.** `Ui.showStatusUpdated(app)` displays the updated application.

#### Sequence Diagram

The following sequence diagram illustrates the flow of updating status and notes:

![Status Sequence Diagram](diagrams/status/sequence.png)

#### Error Handling

| Error Scenario | Condition                              | User Response |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|---------------|
| Missing index | User enters `status s/OFFER` without index | "Please provide an index. Example: status 1 set/OFFER" |
| Invalid index | Index out of range                     | "Invalid application number! You have X application(s)." |
| Invalid format | Missing `s/` or incorrectly formatted  | "Invalid status format! Use: status INDEX set/STATUS note/NOTE" |
| Empty status | User enters `status 1 s/`              | "Status cannot be empty!" |
| Both fields missing | User enters `status 1`                 | "No valid fields to update! Use: set/STATUS and/or note/NOTE" |

#### Design Rationale

| Decision                            | Rationale |
|-------------------------------------|----------|
| Separate `status` and `notes` fields | Improves data clarity and allows independent updates |
| Optional `note/` field              | Supports updating status without overwriting existing notes |
| Backward compatibility              | Existing applications with combined format are migrated correctly |
| Dedicated `StatusParser`            | Maintains separation of concerns and simplifies testing |
| `s/` and `note/` prefixes           | Consistent with existing command patterns (`c/`, `p/`, `d/`) |
