## Overview
JobPilot is a CLI application for job seekers to track applications efficiently. Users can add, edit, delete, search, and sort applications with status tracking and industry tags.

I led the implementation of the editor feature, designed and built the modular parser system, and enhanced the application model to support mutable fields.

### Enhancements Implemented

#### Application Model Enhancement
Enhanced the `Application` class with setter methods and industry tag support.

**Key Features:**
- Setters: `setCompany`, `setPosition`, `setDate`, `setStatus`, `setNotes`
- Integrated `IndustryTag` for application categorization
- Input validation and assertions for data integrity

#### Editor Application Feature
Implemented the `edit` command to modify existing applications – update company, position, date, or status in a single command.

**Format:** `edit INDEX [c/COMPANY] [p/POSITION] [d/DATE] [s/STATUS]`

**Key Features:**
- Partial updates (only specified fields change)
- Handles multi-word inputs (e.g., "Senior Software Engineer")
- Validates `YYYY-MM-DD` date format
- Clear error messages for invalid indices or empty fields

**Why it's complete:**
- Supports any combination of fields (e.g., update only company, or all four at once)
- Handles multi-word values (e.g., "Senior Software Engineer") correctly
- Validates date format (`YYYY-MM-DD`) and rejects invalid dates
- Provides clear error messages for invalid indices, empty fields, and malformed input

**Implementation complexity:**
- Required designing a prefix-based parser that extracts fields without breaking on spaces
- Needed careful whitespace normalization to handle user input with extra spaces
- Involved adding setter methods to the `Application` class while preserving immutability where needed
- Integrated with existing command loop without breaking other features

#### Parser System Refactoring
Designed and built a modular parser system that routes commands to dedicated subparsers.

**Key Features:**
- `Parser` class with `CommandType` enum
- `ParsedCommand` data class for clean command data
- Prefix-based parsing (`c/`, `p/`, `d/`, `s/`) that preserves spaces in values
- Subparsers: `ApplicationParser`, `DeleterParser`, `EditorParser`, `FilterParser`, `SearcherParser`, `StatusParser`, `TaggerParser`

**Why it's complete:**
- Encapsulates all parsing logic in one place, separate from command execution
- Uses a `CommandType` enum for clean routing
- Returns a `ParsedCommand` object containing all parsed data
- Subparsers each handle one command, making the system easy to extend

- Uses a CommandType enum for clean routing
- Returns a ParsedCommand object containing all parsed data 
- Subparsers (ApplicationParser, DeleterParser, EditorParser, etc.) each handle one command, making the system easy to extend

**Implementation complexity:**
- Designed a prefix-based parsing algorithm that correctly captures multi-word values (e.g., `c/Amazon Web Services`)
- Implemented robust error handling so malformed commands produce user-friendly messages
- Created a flexible `ParsedCommand` data class that supports different constructors for different command types
- Ensured the parser works consistently across all commands, reducing duplicate code
